# LIP 1: Swap URI scheme

## Overview

To enable system and apps to communicate swap requestsa and parameters in a standard way, we need a URI scheme which can encode any given swap request.

## Motivation

Swap applications and protocols are disparate even though they usually share the same underlying contract standards - [BIP-199](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0199.mediawiki), [ERC-1630](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1631). If a standard language can be used to share the underlying data across applications, swaps can occur between systems without them understanding the underlying implementation details.

## Specification

The swap URI scheme is as follows. For compatibality with [web standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler#Permitted_schemes) and to allow browsers to register the protocol handler to web applications, the `web+` prefix is used.

`web+swap://[param]=<value>&[param]=<value>&[param]=<value>`

### Parameters

#### Assets

- `from`: The base currency associated with the swap. The value should follow standard cryptocurrency codes with atleast 3 characters in uppercase. 
Example: `BTC`

- `to`: The to currency associated with the swap. The value should follow standard cryptocurrency codes with atleast 3 characters in uppercase. 
Example: `BTC`

- `rate`: The rate at which `from` should be swapped with `to`. The rate must be a float.
Example: `1.22`

#### Addresses

- `fromAddress`: The address of the `from` currency

- `toAddress`: The address of the `to` currency

- `fromCounterPartyAddress`: The counter party address to set for the `from` currency

- `toCounterPartyAddress`: The counter party address to set for the `to` currency

#### Details 

- `preimageHash`: The hash of the preimage relating to the HTLC used to lock funds. The hash must be 32 bytes, encoded in a HEX format. 
Example: `577efecd8ac35e9819b61cb00f9c1e0724ea4f4b40ff617676aa3e192e783bf1`

- `expiration`: The expiration time of the swap. The expiration must be UNIX seconds timestamp.
Exmaple: `1563229621`

- `fundHash`: If the initiating party has already locked funds, the hash belonging to that transaction.
Example: 9036695d2841be8f29b62c4c7a7e3ab3b0a7ea5dcb03c39b0a07e58edcfd61b3

### Requirements

#### Currency codes

Currency codes must be in uppercase, at least 3 letters. There is currently no standards proposed for the definition of the codes. A common set of codes are used between exchanges. These codes shall be used. 

#### Addresses

Addresses in the URI scheme should be formatted as per the relevant cryptocurreny's standard address format. For example for Ethereum that would be [EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md).

#### Transactions

Transactions in encoded in the URI scheme should come in HEX format, without the `0x` prefix and all lower case.

### Examples

#### Quote

A quote for a swap can be given by including only the rate and counter party addresses. Using this, the receiver has the information it needs to interact with the quote:

`web+swap://from=BTC&to=ETH&rate=30&fromCounterPartyAddress=0x454f8D6e2b0F6Ca13638cE6E00904D5E75CBA291&toCounterPartyAddress=mvSHVS5pxyjoAnSaFqV5jBGVfFA3rqQJLs`
